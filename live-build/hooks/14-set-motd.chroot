This Ubuntu Core machine is a tiny, transactional edition of Ubuntu,
designed for appliances, firmware and fixed-function VMs.

If all the software you care about is available as snaps, you are in
the right place. If not, you will be more comfortable with classic
deb-based Ubuntu Server or Desktop, where you can mix snaps with
traditional debs. It's a brave new world here in Ubuntu Core!

Please see 'snap --help' for app installation and updates.
